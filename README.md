  # Requirements
  Functional Requirements:
  * The system captures real-time images of the sky using a camera module.
  * The system detects the sun’s position in the image using a trained Deep Learning model (YOLO/SSD) or image processing techniques (OpenCV-based filtering, Hough Transform, etc.).
  * The system calculates the offset of the sun from the center of the frame.
  * The system continuously updates detection in real-time to track the sun’s movement.
